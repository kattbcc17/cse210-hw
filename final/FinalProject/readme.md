# Andres Castro Budget Program
This program allows the user to create a budget based on categories.

The categories have a certain number of money and are divided into variable expenses (Recurring) and fixed expenses (One time).

The User can add different expenses and the program will create a new file for each month in which the user will enter each of the expenses of the month.

In addition, the program notifies the user of the categories that are out of the budget, and a summary of the expenses of the month.

The user will also be able to review all the expenses of heavy months.
